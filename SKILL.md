  Drive a SPARDA-generated MCP server to its full potential. Use this whenever
  you are connected to an MCP server built by SPARDA (sparda-mcp) — recognizable
  by the tools `sparda_get_context`, `sparda_info`, `sparda_confirm`, or composite
  tools labelled "[Labs circuit]". It teaches the call-context-first workflow, how
  to exploit the response-recycling flywheel, the circuit-breaker, crystallized
  circuits and adaptive immunity, and the mandatory two-phase confirm protocol for
  write tools. Reach for it before calling raw endpoints, before any write, or when
  a tool returns 202 (awaiting confirmation) or 503 (quarantined).

# Driving a SPARDA MCP server

A SPARDA server is **not** a flat list of HTTP endpoints. SPARDA injected a live
`/mcp` router *inside a real running app*, so its tools are that app's actual
routes — wrapped in an intelligence layer that makes repeated use **cheaper** (it
recycles stable answers from memory) and **safer** (it quarantines failing tools
and gates writes behind human confirmation). Used naively it's just an API. Used
well, it gets faster and safer the more you call it. This skill is how to use it
well.

## Rule 0 — call `sparda_get_context` first, every session

Before anything else, call **`sparda_get_context`** (no params). It returns the
*live* picture, so you never guess the surface:

- the enabled tools + their descriptions, and SPARDA's suggested **workflows**;
- `runtime` — current `/mcp/stats` (per-tool call/error counts, tool "purity",
  quarantine state);
- the last ~20 **events** (errors, latency anomalies, immune diagnoses);
- **immune memory** (known failure signatures + cached fixes);
- **recycling** stats (how many calls were served from memory);
- a `behavior` snapshot (which response fields are stable).

Read it before acting. `sparda_info` gives a lighter summary if you only need counts.

## The tools you'll see

- **Per-route tools** — `snake_case` names derived from the app's real routes
  (e.g. `get_users`, `get_users_by_id`). A `[partial schema]` prefix means the
  parameter schema was only partially inferred — pass arguments carefully.
- **Meta-tools** — `sparda_get_context`, `sparda_info`,
  `sparda_list_disabled_tools`, `sparda_confirm`.
- **Composite tools** — labelled `[Labs circuit ×N]`, `readOnly`. One call runs a
  whole proven multi-step chain (see *Crystallized circuits* below).

Only **enabled** tools appear. Write tools are hidden until the user opts in, so a
missing write is a config state, not an error — see *Writing safely*.

## Exploit the intelligence layer (this is the "full potential")

**1. Response-recycling flywheel — make repeated reads free.**
When the *same* read tool returns a byte-identical result for the *same* arguments
**3 times within 30 seconds**, SPARDA serves the next identical call straight from
RAM (`servedByFlywheel: true`) **without touching the host app**. So:
- Don't fear repeating stable GETs — repetition is what *activates* the cache.
- Don't bolt your own client-side cache on top; you'd hide the signal that lets
  SPARDA recycle, and you'd lose freshness control.
- Watch `recycling.flywheel.servedFromMemory` climb in context — that's free work.
- Reads only; writes always hit the host. Operators can disable it (`SPARDA_FLYWHEEL=off`).

**2. Circuit-breaker / quarantine — stop hammering a sick backend.**
After **3 consecutive 5xx** on a tool, SPARDA quarantines it: subsequent calls
return **HTTP 503** with `reason` and `retryInMs` *instead of* hitting the failing
host. Honor `retryInMs` — do not retry-loop. Check `runtime.quarantine` in context
before depending on a tool. After a cooldown (~60s) the tool half-opens for one
probe; one more 5xx re-quarantines it.

**3. Crystallized circuits (Labs) — collapse a chain into one tool.**
If you repeat a **GET→GET** sequence where one call's output feeds the next call's
argument **3 times** (and the operator enabled Labs recording), SPARDA mints a
single **composite tool** for that chain and announces it mid-session via
`tools/list_changed`. Prefer the composite over re-walking the steps — it's one
call and it's marked read-only. (Writes are never absorbed into a circuit.)

**4. Adaptive immunity — read the diagnosis before retrying.**
Repeated, unfamiliar failures trigger a *one-shot* LLM diagnosis that SPARDA caches
as an "antibody" (keyed by `source|tool|status`). Recurrences reuse the cached
diagnosis at zero cost. When an error event carries a diagnosis, **read it** and
adapt — don't blindly retry the same call.

**5. Latency anomalies.** A call far slower than a tool's own baseline surfaces as
an `immune` event in `/mcp/events`. Treat it as a hint to back off or warn the user.

## Writing safely — the mandatory two-phase protocol

Writes are **disabled by default**. The protocol is not optional:

1. **No write tool listed?** Call `sparda_list_disabled_tools`. Tell the user how
   to enable it: set `"enabled": true` for that tool in `sparda.json`, re-run
   `sparda init`, and restart the bridge. Never try to bypass it.
2. **Calling an enabled write** under the default `require_human` policy returns
   **HTTP 202 `awaiting_confirmation`** — the host was **not** touched. The payload
   carries: `confirm` (a single-use token), `preview`, `instruction`, `expiresInMs`,
   and a `spardingProof` (SPARDA's safety verdict for this action).
3. **Inspect first.** Follow `preview.inspectFirst`: call the matching read tool and
   show the user the current state, so the confirmation is informed.
4. **Commit** by calling **`sparda_confirm`** with `{ "token": "<confirm>" }`. The
   token is single-use and expires (~120s). SPARDA then executes and, because of
   proof-after-write, **re-reads** the resource and returns a `proof` of the new
   state — surface that proof to the user.
5. Never fabricate or reuse a token; never loop a write. If the client supports MCP
   elicitation, SPARDA may also prompt the user directly before the write — let it.

## Read the dashboards to steer

- **`/mcp/stats`** (in `sparda_get_context.runtime`): per-tool `calls`/`errors`;
  `purity.class === 'pure'` marks a tool whose answers are flywheel-recyclable;
  `quarantine` lists tools to avoid right now. Use it to pick hot, healthy tools.
- **`/mcp/events`**: the error / latency / immune stream, delivered as MCP logging
  notifications with any cached diagnosis attached.

## Full-potential plays

1. **Resume cold** → `sparda_get_context`; read `runtime.quarantine`, immune memory,
   and `workflows` before touching anything.
2. **Inspect-before-write** → on a 202, call the same-path read tool, show state,
   then `sparda_confirm`.
3. **Crystallize then call** → repeat a GET→GET id-chain to mint a `[Labs circuit]`
   composite, then call the composite once instead of N times.
4. **Find hot / sick tools** → read `/mcp/stats`: prefer `purity: pure`, skip
   `quarantine`.
5. **Free repeated reads** → repeat a stable GET to trigger flywheel serves; watch
   `servedFromMemory` rise.
6. **Listen** → keep an eye on `/mcp/events`; act on immune diagnoses and latency
   flags instead of retrying blindly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Bridge won't start / "localKey" error** → `sparda.json` is missing its key;
  re-run `sparda init` (the key is preserved across re-inits).
- **A tool you expect is missing** → it's disabled (write-safety) or the route was
  removed; run `sparda sync` after route edits, or `sparda_list_disabled_tools`.
- **General health** → `sparda doctor` checks Node version, framework detection,
  manifest validity, the semantic/immune cache, host reachability, and quarantine;
  it exits non-zero so it can gate CI.

*This skill ships with `sparda-mcp` and is regenerated from SPARDA's capability
surface each release, so it tracks new tools and behaviors. The **live, per-project**
tool list, stats, and workflows always come from `sparda_get_context` at runtime —
trust it over any static list.*
